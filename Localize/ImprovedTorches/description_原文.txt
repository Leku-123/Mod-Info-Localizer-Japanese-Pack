This mod simply adds an orange tint to normal torches and tiki torches, with their placed tiles and biome torches getting a slight flicker for atmosphere. The flicker can be disabled and brightness edited in the mod's config. 

Unfortunately, due to complicated code stuff the flicker can't be added to the held or dropped torch item.
Also, there is an extremely unlikely but possible chance for IL conflicts with other mods, so if you're running a mod that IL edits the exact same obscure line of code this one does, it might cause problems.
