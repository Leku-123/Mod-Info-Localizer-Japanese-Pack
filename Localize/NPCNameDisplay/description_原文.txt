NPC Name Display is a lightweight mod that simply shows NPC names above them.
It displays names for enemies, town NPCs and critters.
The brightness of the names and the range in which name display can be configured in-game.

Be sure to check out my main work, the Vitality Mod, a somewhat large content mod.
