Make the mod list interface more concise.
Greatly optimize the opening time of the mod list. The list can be fully displayed in less than a second when there are about 100 mods

How to use:
- Left click a mod to toggle it
- If a mod is enabled with config available, right-clicking it will open the config
- If a mod is disabled, right-clicking it will delete it
- Middle click a mod to enable all its dependencies
- Click the new button on the top of the mod list to export a list of enabled mod as text

...And with full configuration support! You can adjust whether to show:
- The config button (don't worry, you can still right click on the icon to open the config)
- The steam icon
- The modpack icon
- The "mod updated" dot
- The "no preview build" obsidian skull
- The mod reference icon
- The translation mod icon
